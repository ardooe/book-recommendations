### Artificial Intelligence for Humans, Vol 1: Fundamental Algorithms

- Author: [Jeff Heaton](https://github.com/jeffheaton) :octocat:
- ISBN: 978-1493682225

The basics of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms. All the books in the series are highly recommended but start with this. Recommended book to accompany this: Introduction to the Math of Neural Networks (ISBN: 978-1604390339).

## :teapot: Design

### The Design of Everyday Things

- Author: Donald "Don" Norman
- ISBN: 978-0465050659

Originally published with the title "The Psychology of Everyday Things" in 1988, this book is a classic in the field of interaction design and user experience. Used as a textbook for introduction courses to HCD (Human Centered Design). A good read even if you're not a designer. It will open your eyes to the designs you encounter every day (hence the name).
